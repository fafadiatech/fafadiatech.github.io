# Creating an Impact with "Good Documentation"

Talk given at PyCon Pune 2017 by Vidya Iyengar

* Challenges to get userss to find solution quick and minimum effort
* Good Practices
	- Know your audience
		- Who is reading my documentation?
		- Why are they reading my documentation?
		- One size doesn't fit all
			- Cater to teach type of user separately
			- Document your assumption on your audience
	- Choose a structure wisely
		- Structure your document by features
		- Structure your document by role
	- Separate Information Logically
		- Conceptual Information
		- Procedural Inforamtion
		- Reference Information
		- DONT's
			- Mix either of these with each other
	- Use Keywords
		- Users don't read from start to end and they look at keywords/keyphrases
* Different types of documentation
	- Txt
	- HTML
	- PDF
	- Videos
	- How do you package documentation?
		- Cost of effort
		- Cost of maintenance
