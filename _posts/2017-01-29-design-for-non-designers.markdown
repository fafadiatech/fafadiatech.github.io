[Django Con 2016 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JQBfUnYxXA) nicely explains and gives tips for non-designers. Its a good talk to get you upto some level of competency in designing

- Design: Make an interface that works well
- How can we create effective, basic designs?
- Fastest way to better design is to cut down on clutter
- Line things up - pixel differences are definately unconsciously notices
- Use Bootstrap it has built in grid system that makes life easier
- Color principles: Keep you colors complementary. Use mostly neutrals + one brighter color for important bits
- [A Simple Web Developerâ€™s Guide To Color](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/)
- [Color Lovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/) is a website where people share their color pallets
- Test different color pallets to see which one works
- Fonts:Keep the number of fonts low - two different fonts is usually a good rule of thumb
- Use fnacy/display font sparingly - very cluttery
- Vary weights(bolds), style(italics) and transforms (uppercase, etc.) to differentiate bits. 
- [Beautiful Web Type](http://chad.is/beautiful-web-type/) and [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/) have good curated fonts
- White Space: The ultimate clutter reducer
- Reduce visual clutter, by keepting the number of fonts and colors low, add white space and line things up. Aim for a "clean" design
- User experience principles:
	- How it works is more important than how it looks
	- Whats the most important action on your design?
		- Make it easy to find and use
	- Pay attention to your goals
		- Make it easy to find and use {Use analytics to find how you're design is doing}
	- Content: Less is More
		- Big Paragraph are a sign of clutter. Break into bullets if you can
		- Improve readability by formatting using bolds, italics and add white spaces
		- Headlines:
			- Talk benifits not details
			- Keep it short
			- Use natural, friendly language
	- Image and Imagery:
		- Stock photos usually looks like stock photos
		- You can accomplish a lot with just type and screenshots
		- Remember to pay attention to file size
